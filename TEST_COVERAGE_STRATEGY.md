# Comprehensive Test Coverage Improvement Strategy

## Current Coverage Metrics
- Statements: 58.29%
- Branches: 37.73%
- Functions: 40.27%
- Lines: 58.7%

## Objectives
- Achieve 100% test coverage across backend components
- Improve test quality and comprehensiveness
- Ensure robust error handling and edge case testing

## Systematic Improvement Plan

### 1. Test Suite Infrastructure
- Fix existing test suite failures
- Resolve Mongoose index warnings
- Create missing controllers (e.g., cryptoController)
- Implement proper test timeout handling

### 2. Model Testing Improvements
#### User Model
- Comprehensive user creation scenarios
- Password hashing validation
- Watchlist manipulation tests
- Validation error handling
- Edge case testing for user methods

#### Asset Model
- Complete coverage of asset creation
- Validation and constraint testing
- Method behavior verification

#### Historical Data Model
- Comprehensive data insertion tests
- Time series data handling
- Error scenario testing

### 3. Service Layer Testing
#### Authentication Services
- Login/logout scenarios
- Token generation and validation
- Error handling for authentication failures
- Permission and role-based access tests

#### Market Data Services
- API integration tests
- Error handling for external API calls
- Caching mechanism verification
- Data transformation and validation

#### Specific Service Improvements
- AlphaVantage Service: Maintain current high coverage
- CoinMarketCap Service: Expand error scenario testing
- Market Data Service: Significantly improve low coverage
- Metal Price Service: Maintain current high coverage

### 4. Controller Testing
- Comprehensive request/response cycle testing
- Error handling
- Middleware integration
- Authentication flow verification

### 5. Utility and Error Handling
- Complete coverage of utility functions
- Comprehensive error class testing
- Caching mechanism verification

### 6. Performance and Edge Case Testing
- Stress testing for data-intensive operations
- Boundary condition testing
- Negative scenario coverage

## Implementation Approach
1. Identify uncovered code paths
2. Write targeted test cases
3. Use code coverage tools to verify improvements
4. Iterative refinement of test suites

## Tools and Techniques
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- MongoDB Memory Server for database testing
- Mocking external dependencies
- Comprehensive error simulation

## Metrics Targets
- Statements: 100%
- Branches: 100%
- Functions: 100%
- Lines: 100%

## Ongoing Maintenance
- Integrate test coverage checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular review and update of test suites
- Continuous improvement of test quality
